foreigner
-----------

`foreigner` are one of efforts to port several foreign data wrapper development from `C/C++` language
into safer native high-level language like `rust`. After being ported, it should be easier to maintain
the plugin across OS and low level pg structs.

Several plugins included in `foreigner` are :

- Redis foreign data wrapper
- MySQL foreign data wrapper
- MongoDB foreign data wrapper
- RethinkDB foreign data wrapper
- etc..

Hopefully this project gonna works just fine.
